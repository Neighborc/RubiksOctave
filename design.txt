Layout of cube and color


8 faces with 6 triangles per faces
Best representation standing on truncated flat/square part 
Bridge pieces dictate orientation not central pieces. 

Colors(8): Y/Yellow, G/Green, R/Red, B/Blue, O/Orange, A/Gray, W/White, P/Purple, 
Bridges(12): Y-A, Y-O, Y-R, O-P, O-B, R-G, G-A, R-P, G-W, A-B, B-W, P-W 

Solving for layout:

-X-X-X-X-             -Y-A-G-R-   Top level is "Jaeger!"
 | | | |     -->       | | | |       
-X-X-X-X-             -O-B-W-P-        

Represented in an array 4x12 as 

Y Y Y A A A G G G R R R
Y Y Y A A A G G G R R R
O O O B B B W W W P P P
O O O B B B W W W P P P


Actions:
4 angles x 3 axes of rotation x 2 directions = 24 possible moves each turn.

For second actions in sequence only a few are eliminated which are either reversed or their order isn't important
